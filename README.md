# JUMBLEDD_PASSWORD

# DETAILS
This code was created to generate a random password based on a minimum of 8 characters.<br>

How I made changes to the starter code..<br>
I started by editing the HTML and adding the requirements for the password as a label.<br>
I added that the password must be a minimum of 8 characters and no more than 128.<br>
I added that the password must include atleast one uppercase, one number and one special character.<br>
I declared approriate variables needed for my code to respond to.<br>
I added a message alert for the password.<br>
I created an if else statement for the password requirements.

# WHAT I LEARNED FROM THIS CHALLENGE
I learned how to use an if else statement.<br>
I learned how to make an alert message.
